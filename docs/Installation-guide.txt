Getting Concorde to work on MacOS Catalina/Linux Ubuntu (tested on 18.04 and 19.10)

Linear Programming Module QSOPT:

Download from http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/qsopt/beta/index.html
    - Only qsopt.h and qsopt.a are needed 
    - Put qsopt.h and qsopt.a in to a folder (named QSOPT)
    - Export the directory of QSOPT into an environment variable for storage 
        - $ export QSOPTDIR=absolute/path/to/QSOPT

Concorde

Download from http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde/downloads/downloads.htm
    - File: Concorde-03.12.19  (date: Dec 19, 2003) 
    - It will be downloaded as co031219.tgz
    - On terminal, run 
        - $ gunzip co031219.tgz
        - $ tar xvf co031219.tar
    - The concorde folder should appear as a result
    - cd into concorde folder 
    - On terminal, run
        - $ export CFLAGS="-g -O3 -arch x86_64" if on MacOS
	- $ export CFLAGS="-g -O3 -no-pie" if on Linux Ubuntu
        - $ ./configure --with-qsopt=$QSOPTDIR 
        - $ make


To test the concorde solver, download the data of any of the tsp file on http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/data/index.html  
    - cd into concorde/TSP 
    - On terminal, run
        - $ ./concorde path/to/tsp/file

If this runs, good. You're almost ready. In order to properly run the R code, one has to have "TSP" package in R (one time install with "install.packages("TSP")). At the beginning of each session in RStudio/other R interactive, one have to run the glue code:
    > library("TSP")
    > concorde_path("absolute/path/to/concorde/TSP")

note: concorde solver is in the TSP folder.
