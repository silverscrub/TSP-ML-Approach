# TSP-ML-Approach
Luther Summer 2020 Research - Loi "Lewis" Mai

This project concerns the accuracy and computational aspect of the Travelling Salesman Problem. The problem asks what is the optimal route to visit every node exactly once in a complete graph of n vertices. 

This project aims to demonstrate a viable Divide and Conquer heuristic to approximate the optimal solution in the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Using the Concorde solver which always finds the optimal solutions but might take considerable amount of time, the authors wants to check if running the Concorde Solver on neighborhoods of points would yields close to the best result while saving time. 

Main programming language used: R 

Install instructions and work assessment (benchmark) are included in the "doc" folder.

Future work: There is a lot of room to improve on this heuristic method. If anyone wants to collaborate on this method, feel free to contact me at loi.maichien99@gmail.com or mailo01@luther.edu (valid until 2022).
