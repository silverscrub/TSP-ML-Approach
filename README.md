# TSP-ML-Approach
Luther Summer Research - Lewis Mai

This project concerns the computational aspect of the Travelling Salesman Problem. The problem asks what is the optimal route to visit every node exactly once in a complete graph of n vertices. 

The main programming language used is R since there is a specific TSP module that deals with TSP basic algorithms. 

The goals of the project is to produce an algorithm that tackles the TSP problems and then pinpoint the big-O complexities and the behavior with more complex graph.
